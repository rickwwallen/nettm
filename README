REQUIREMENTS

Requires to have an installed version of gawk (not mawk) aliased to awk.


--------------------

GNU_GPL is the license for gcc, binutils and newlib. They are included
in binary form and the source code can be obtained from:

http://gcc.gnu.org 
http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
http://sourceware.org/newlib/

If you compile these tools from source, use the MIPS-1 target, use the
software multiplies/divides/floating point and disable branch delay
slots. The load delay slots are not required so they can be removed
for extra performance.

A restricted version of the standard C library is precompiled. You can
choose to use the malloc memory allocator, otherwise the system
defaults to a multithreaded memory allocator based on:
