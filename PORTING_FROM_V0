Since NetTM has split input and output packet buffer like NetThreads (but unlike NetThreads-RE),
there should be very little code changes required to port an application to NetTM. The main aspect to keep in mind is that the lock identifiers have a meaning attached to each of them. In particular, looking at support.h in src/bench/common, in the following lock identifiers:

#define LOCK_INIT 0
#define LOCK_PO_MEM 2
#define SENDING_LOCK  3
#define MALLOCFREE_LOCK  4

are non-transactional identifiers (e.g. normal).

#define LOCK_MISC 1
 is not a lock identified. Calling nf_lock() on this identifier will block the thread until a packet is available to be processed.

The other lock identifiers (5 to 15 inclusively) are transactional locks, meaning that nf_lock will trigger a transaction to start and nf_unlock, a transaction commit.
